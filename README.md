# Preface

Lately I've been posting my cooking on Instagram quite frequently, and I usually use the same format for all of my post captions. Of course, repetitive tasks call for solutions solved by programming. Perfect way to practice development is working on a project that benefits yourself. Thanks for reading. 

To start, here is the link to my Instagram, which is the main focus here.

# Problem
I write captions for my instagram posts everyday, and these posts have somewhat repetitive tasks that are timeconsuming. 
Here is a list of some of these problems:
1. Having to check what number post the is
1. Translating ingredients list between Japanese and English
1. Listing the recipe notes nicely
1. Coming up with 30 hashtags for each post


# Solution

My goal here was to minimize the time it would take me to write a post's captions, while learning more JS along the way.
I'll list some of the things I did here to acheive this goal.
1. AJAX request to detect what the next post number should be
1. Using an Internal dictionary and the Google Translate API to automatically translate ingredients list
1. Format the content nicely so caption looks neat, for example new lines showing up properly when caption is posted.
1. Randomly generate 30 popular hashtags(US and JPN) to add to caption
1. Add a "copy to clipboard" functionality to quickly add caption to post
